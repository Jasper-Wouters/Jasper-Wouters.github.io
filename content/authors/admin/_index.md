#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

As a Senior Scientist specializing in Computational Biology, I have dedicated over a decade to unraveling the complexities of cancer heterogeneity and cell therapy. Armed with a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from KU Leuven and a mini-MBA in Entrepreneurship from Innotek, I thrive at the intersection of data and biology.

My expertise lies in leading and executing computational biology projects in drug and target discovery, particularly utilizing single-cell 'omics. I have successfully integrated several promising targets into research pipelines, managed multiple collaborations, led computational investigations, and implemented NGS technologies. My passion is to leverage my skills to advance cancer therapy and improve patient outcomes.

A glimpse into my background:

- 🖥️ Bioinformatician with a decade of research experience in single-cell biology, combining wet lab and computational skills
- 💉 Spearheaded projects in Cell Therapy, focusing on data-driven, innovative approaches to complex biological questions
- 🎯 Specialized in Oncology, driven by an enthusiasm for unraveling insights through single-cell and multi-omics technologies
- 🧠 Problem-solver with a get-it-done mentality and a thirst for learning
