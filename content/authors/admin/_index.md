#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

As a Senior Scientist specializing in Computational Biology, I have dedicated over a decade to unraveling the complexities of cancer research and cell therapy. Armed with a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from KU Leuven and a mini-MBA in Entrepreneurship from Innotek, I thrive at the intersection of data and biology.

My expertise lies in data-driven target identification and drug target discovery projects, particularly utilizing single-cell transcriptomics. I have successfully integrated several promising targets into research pipelines, managed multiple collaborations, led computational investigations, and implemented NGS technologies. My passion is to leverage my skills to advance cell therapy and improve patient outcomes.

As I embark on a new chapter, I‚Äôm actively seeking opportunities as a Senior or Principal Scientist in Computational Biology or Bioinformatics within the pharma, biotech, or consulting industries. If you know of any relevant openings or simply want to connect, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out! And if you‚Äôre up for a hike while discussing bioinformatics, count me in! ü•æ

A glimpse into my background:

üñ•Ô∏è Bioinformatician with a decade of research experience in single-cell biology, merging wet lab and computational skills
üíâ Spearheaded projects in Cell Therapy, focusing on innovative approaches to complex biological questions
üéØ Specialized in Oncology, driven by an enthusiasm for unraveling insights through single-cell and multi-omics technologies
üß† Problem-solver with a get-it-done mentality and a thirst for learning
Looking for:

üíº Roles as a Senior or Principal Bioinformatician, Bioinformatics Scientist, Bioinformatics Analyst, or Computational Biologist
üåé Opportunities in Belgium (hybrid) or remote positions across Europe
